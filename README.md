## Hello, world! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile. <br>
I'm a **frontend developer** with a passion for creating stunning, user-friendly web experiences. 

As a **graphic design graduate,** I strive to create websites that are both creative and functional, with a focus on responsive design, accessibility, and user experience. I believe that good design should be accessible to everyone, and I'm committed to making the web a more inclusive and user-friendly place.

When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me sipping on a cup of coffee, binge-watching TV series, or taking bike rides around the city.<br>
