### Hey there, welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **frontend developer** with a passion for creating stunning, user-friendly web experiences. 

As a **graphic design graduate,** I strive to create websites that are both creative and functional, with a focus on responsive design, accessibility, and user experience. I believe that good design should be accessible to everyone, and I'm committed to making the web a more inclusive and user-friendly place. 

When I'm not crafting code, you'll find me sipping on a cup of coffee, binge-watching TV series, or taking bike rides around the city.

```javascript
encourageToCheckOutProjects();

const encourageToCheckOutProjects = () => {
  const messages = [
    "If you're interested in my work, be sure to check out my projects on GitHub!",
    "Curious about what I've been working on? Head over to my GitHub to see my latest projects!",
    "Want to see more of my work? Check out my projects on GitHub!",
    "I've got some awesome projects on GitHub that I'd love for you to check out!",
    "Looking for more? Head over to my GitHub and explore my projects!"
  ];
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length);
  const message = messages[randomIndex];
  return message;
}
```
